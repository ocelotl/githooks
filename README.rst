Git Hooks
=========

In this repo you'll find all the provided hooks in the ``hooks`` folder.

Copy the executable and ``.py`` (except the ones that begin with ``test_``)
files to ``.git/hooks`` to use the hooks.

For example, to use the ``commit-msg`` hook, copy ``./hooks/commit-msg`` and
``./hooks/commit_message.py`` to your local git repo hooks folder located in
``.git/hooks`` from your repo root folder.
